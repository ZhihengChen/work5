                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>In a world increasingly dominated by digital communication, our personal connections have grown distant. We rely on images, videos, and sounds, often overlooking the richness of our senses. This project stems from a desire to change that.</p>
                <p>I aim to create an installation that marries human sensory perception with the art of photography. Audiences won't just see photographs; they'll feel the warmth of the sun, the caress of the wind, the scent of the moment. This immersive experience is designed to rekindle our connection to the world and each other.</p>

                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>
                
                <p>The concept behind my project is rooted in addressing the contemporary shift towards digital communication, which has resulted in reduced face-to-face interactions and a lack of multisensory engagement. My creative inspiration comes from a personal desire to bridge this emotional and sensory gap by fusing human sensory experiences with the art of photography.</p>
                <p>My background research involves a comprehensive exploration of sensory perception, emotional impact, and the profound significance of reconnecting with our senses and environment. I've delved into the works of Kenya Hara, as found in "Designing Design," to gain valuable insights into the realm of design philosophy. Moreover, I've examined Li Jing Li Shiguo's research, which explores the intricate dynamics of human-product interaction, offering deeper insights into this relationship. </p>
                <p>Furthermore, I've delved into Sang Ruijuan's writings, which shed light on experience design from a sensory perspective. Liu Wei's discussions on synesthesia within product design have also enriched my understanding of how various senses interact and influence one another. Hu Fei's emphasis on User-Centered Design theory and practice has provided a valuable framework to consider user needs and sensory experiences in the context of my project.</p>
                <p>These research endeavors form the solid theoretical foundation of my project, enabling me to seamlessly integrate photography with multisensory experiences. They empower me to achieve deeper and more profound communication and emotional connection through my work. This research not only informs my creative process but also allows me to explore the realms of creativity, sensibility, and technology more deeply.</p>
                <p>My project situates itself within the tradition of interactive and experiential art, where the audience actively engages with the artwork on a multisensory level. It seeks to revitalize the richness of human sensory experiences within the context of photography. By bridging the gap between technology, art, and human senses, I aim to encourage a deeper connection with our surroundings and promote emotional engagement in a world increasingly dominated by one-dimensional digital communication.</p>

                <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
                <p>The implementation of my project involved several key technical elements and hardware components to create a multisensory experience for the audience. I first determined the various sensory experiences I wanted to provide, which included simulating wind, temperature, and air humidity. To achieve this, I incorporated three electrical appliances into my installation: a fan to simulate wind, a fan heater to control temperature, and a humidifier to manage air humidity.</p>
                <p>Video part, the choice of using a video I had previously captured during a fishing trip at sea was intentional. The maritime environment differs significantly from our daily surroundings, particularly in terms of wind, temperature, and air humidity. By selecting this video, I aimed to emphasize the contrast and provide a unique sensory experience for the audience.</p>
                <p>The presentation format for the entire project was determined to be a video projection using a projector, combined with the control of wind, temperature, and air humidity by the installation itself. This combination creates an immersive experience that complements the visual aspect of the video.</p>
                <p>From a technical standpoint, I employed ultrasonic sensors to control the operation of the installation. These sensors detected the distance between a person's hand and the installation. When the distance fell below a predefined threshold, it triggered the operation of servos, which, in turn, controlled the switches for the fan, fan heater, and humidifier via remote control.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I used LED light strips to provide visual feedback on the operational status of the installation, indicating whether it was running or not.</p>

                <h3>Reflection and Future Development</h3>
                <p>This project was a success in many ways, deepening my understanding of the importance of multisensory experiences and how technology and creativity can be harnessed to create more immersive art. Here are some reflections and lessons learned:</p>
                <p>Project Highlights:</p>
                <p>1. Multisensory Experience: By combining electrical appliances, video, and ultrasonic sensors, I successfully crafted a multisensory experience, allowing the audience to not only see but also feel sensory cues like wind, temperature, and humidity.</p>
                <p>2. Technical Mastery: The project's technical implementation improved my proficiency with ultrasonic sensors, servos, and electrical devices, expanding the possibilities for future creations.</p>
                <p>3. Innovation: Choosing a video captured during a fishing trip at sea was deliberate, creating an environment distinct from daily life, particularly in terms of wind, temperature, and humidity.</p>
                <p>However, upon reflection, I realized that the integration of video playback and the interactive installation could have been more seamless, resulting in a less immersive experience. To address this in future versions or developments, I am considering directly embedding the screen within the installation to enhance the overall flow and integration of the interactive process.</p>
                <p>Key Takeaways:</p>
                <p>1. User Engagement: The highlight of the project was audience interaction with the installation, underscoring the importance of user experience. I will pay greater attention to how to involve the audience more in the future.</p>
                <p>2. Hardware Integration: Through the implementation, I learned how to efficiently integrate various hardware components to achieve the desired effects. This will assist in addressing technical challenges more effectively in future projects.</p>
                <p>Future Developments:</p>
                <p>Should I create another version of this project or further expand my ideas, I will take the following steps:</p>
                <p>1. Screen Integration: I will directly embed the screen within the installation to enhance the integration of video playback and the interactive elements, creating a more immersive experience.</p>
                <p>2. User Participation: Actively collecting feedback and opinions from the audience will be a priority to improve and optimize the project. User input is crucial for continuous improvement and development.</p>
                <p>In summary, this project provided valuable experience and inspiration. I hope to continue exploring the possibilities of multisensory art and creating more immersive and emotionally resonant works. Future directions include enhancing interactivity, integrating screens for improved cohesion, and involving users more extensively, all aimed at making future projects more engaging and meaningful.</p>
