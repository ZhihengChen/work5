                <h3>简介</h3>
                <p>在这个日益由数字通信主导的世界里，我们的人际关系变得越来越疏远。我们依赖于图像、视频和声音，往往忽略了我们丰富的感官。这个项目就是为了改变这种状况。</p>
                <p>我的目标是创造一种将人类感官与摄影艺术相结合的装置艺术。观众不仅能看到照片，还能感受到阳光的温暖、风的轻抚和此刻的气息。这种身临其境的体验旨在重新点燃我们与世界和彼此的联系。</p>

                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>
                
                <p>The concept behind my project is rooted in addressing the contemporary shift towards digital communication, which has resulted in reduced face-to-face interactions and a lack of multisensory engagement. My creative inspiration comes from a personal desire to bridge this emotional and sensory gap by fusing human sensory experiences with the art of photography.</p>
                <p>My background research involves a comprehensive exploration of sensory perception, emotional impact, and the profound significance of reconnecting with our senses and environment. I've delved into the works of Kenya Hara, as found in "Designing Design," to gain valuable insights into the realm of design philosophy. Moreover, I've examined Li Jing Li Shiguo's research, which explores the intricate dynamics of human-product interaction, offering deeper insights into this relationship. </p>
                <p>Furthermore, I've delved into Sang Ruijuan's writings, which shed light on experience design from a sensory perspective. Liu Wei's discussions on synesthesia within product design have also enriched my understanding of how various senses interact and influence one another. Hu Fei's emphasis on User-Centered Design theory and practice has provided a valuable framework to consider user needs and sensory experiences in the context of my project.</p>
                <p>These research endeavors form the solid theoretical foundation of my project, enabling me to seamlessly integrate photography with multisensory experiences. They empower me to achieve deeper and more profound communication and emotional connection through my work. This research not only informs my creative process but also allows me to explore the realms of creativity, sensibility, and technology more deeply.</p>
                <p>My project situates itself within the tradition of interactive and experiential art, where the audience actively engages with the artwork on a multisensory level. It seeks to revitalize the richness of human sensory experiences within the context of photography. By bridging the gap between technology, art, and human senses, I aim to encourage a deeper connection with our surroundings and promote emotional engagement in a world increasingly dominated by one-dimensional digital communication.</p>

                <h3>技术实施</h3>
                <p>我的项目实施涉及几个关键技术要素和硬件组件，以便为观众创造多感官体验。我首先确定了要提供的各种感官体验，包括模拟风、温度和空气湿度。为此，我在装置中加入了三种电器：模拟风的风扇、控制温度的风扇加热器和管理空气湿度的加湿器。</p>
                <p>视频部分，选择使用我之前在海上钓鱼时拍摄的视频是有意为之。海上环境与我们日常所处的环境有很大不同，尤其是在风、温度和空气湿度方面。通过选择这段视频，我旨在强调这种反差，为观众提供一种独特的感官体验。</p>
                <p>整个项目的展示形式被确定为使用投影仪进行视频投影，并结合装置本身对风、温度和空气湿度的控制。这种组合创造了一种身临其境的体验，与视频的视觉效果相得益彰。</p>
                <p>从技术角度来看，我采用了超声波传感器来控制装置的运行。这些传感器检测人的手与装置之间的距离。当距离低于预先设定的阈值时，就会触发伺服器的运行，进而通过遥控器控制风扇、风扇加热器和加湿器的开关。</p>
                <p>此外，我还使用了 LED 灯带，为装置的运行状态提供视觉反馈，显示装置是否正在运行。</p>

                <h3>Reflection and Future Development</h3>
                <p>This project was a success in many ways, deepening my understanding of the importance of multisensory experiences and how technology and creativity can be harnessed to create more immersive art. Here are some reflections and lessons learned:</p>
                <p>Project Highlights:</p>
                <p>1. Multisensory Experience: By combining electrical appliances, video, and ultrasonic sensors, I successfully crafted a multisensory experience, allowing the audience to not only see but also feel sensory cues like wind, temperature, and humidity.</p>
                <p>2. Technical Mastery: The project's technical implementation improved my proficiency with ultrasonic sensors, servos, and electrical devices, expanding the possibilities for future creations.</p>
                <p>3. Innovation: Choosing a video captured during a fishing trip at sea was deliberate, creating an environment distinct from daily life, particularly in terms of wind, temperature, and humidity.</p>
                <p>However, upon reflection, I realized that the integration of video playback and the interactive installation could have been more seamless, resulting in a less immersive experience. To address this in future versions or developments, I am considering directly embedding the screen within the installation to enhance the overall flow and integration of the interactive process.</p>
                <p>Key Takeaways:</p>
                <p>1. User Engagement: The highlight of the project was audience interaction with the installation, underscoring the importance of user experience. I will pay greater attention to how to involve the audience more in the future.</p>
                <p>2. Hardware Integration: Through the implementation, I learned how to efficiently integrate various hardware components to achieve the desired effects. This will assist in addressing technical challenges more effectively in future projects.</p>
                <p>Future Developments:</p>
                <p>Should I create another version of this project or further expand my ideas, I will take the following steps:</p>
                <p>1. Screen Integration: I will directly embed the screen within the installation to enhance the integration of video playback and the interactive elements, creating a more immersive experience.</p>
                <p>2. User Participation: Actively collecting feedback and opinions from the audience will be a priority to improve and optimize the project. User input is crucial for continuous improvement and development.</p>
                <p>In summary, this project provided valuable experience and inspiration. I hope to continue exploring the possibilities of multisensory art and creating more immersive and emotionally resonant works. Future directions include enhancing interactivity, integrating screens for improved cohesion, and involving users more extensively, all aimed at making future projects more engaging and meaningful.</p>
